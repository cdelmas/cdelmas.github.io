<h2 id="_let_me_introduce_myself">Let me introduce myself</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I decided to have a blog. My recent readings pushed me to create it, finally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing I think I have to do is to introduce myself. It&#8217;s always interesting to know who is the author of the post you&#8217;re reading. It gives context, and helps understand why that article was written.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m a software developer, and I love it. I&#8217;ve been writing C, C++, Lisp, and (mostly) Java software for about 9 years, both in industry (printing), biology, and web app back ends.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_what_can_you_expect_from_this_blog">What can you expect from this blog?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be honest, I don&#8217;t have in mind to learn you many things. Maybe some posts will be of some help, yet. Anyway, it will be helpful for myself, as this blog will probably be a log of things I discover and I would like to remember.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I will write about Java, not so surprisingly. Java is probably the most interesting ecosystem for enterprise development nowadays, as you have a huge choice of libraries and frameworks to help you. I will explore some of them, as technological watch is one of my favorite activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As technical as the previous (main?) subject will be some craftsmanship techniques. I try (very very&#8230;&#8203;) hard to be a good developer (mastery is far from me at the moment), and I&#8217;m always seeking for techniques that can help me. I will expose some of them I believe help me write better software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another important thing, readings. Every developer should read books and blogs about <em>developing software</em>. Books about that library or that language are good too&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;well, not all books are good --, but you should focus on long term books, those which are not bound timely. I have some examples in mind (I will write a post about that).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, I will also write about Agile. This term is overused, and sometimes I hear and see people believing they <em>do agile</em>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;what? I&#8217;m not an agile guru or so, but I think I can give my opinion about that.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_final_word">Final word</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dude, this post is quite longer than I expected at first. But it is not too long, so I hope you will read it entirely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Good reading!</p>
