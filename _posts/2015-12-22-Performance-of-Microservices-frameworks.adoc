Using Gatling to measure the performance

Methodology

Get on a /hello endpoint, with 200 users making 1000 requests each (total:Â 200000); a request is considered as failed if it exceeds 60s. The test is time boxed (limit: 5 minutes).
Response is json-encoded POJO

Results

mean, throughput, errors
