This is the follow-up of my article about https://cdelmas.github.io/2015/11/01/A-comparison-of-Microservices-Frameworks.html[Microservices Frameworks].

Some observations:

* Under Unix, vertx is faster at startup (about 200ms)


Using Gatling to measure the performance

Methodology

Get on a /hello endpoint, with 200 users making 1000 requests each (total: 200000); a request is considered as failed if it exceeds 60s. The test is time boxed (limit: 5 minutes).
Post on a /hello endpoint, with 200 users making 1000 requests each (total: 200000); a request is considered as failed if it exceeds 60s. The test is time boxed (limit: 10 minutes).

Response is json-encoded POJO
Payload is json.
